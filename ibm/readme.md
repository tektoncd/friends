# IBM

- IBM is actively contributing to the Tekton project and using it as the foundation CI/CD technology for building cloud-native applications on Kubernetes in our public and hybrid clouds
- We have invested UX and development resources to contribute the Tekton Dashboard to make Tekton easy to use for all developers
- IBM strongly supports efforts to standardize CI/CD building blocks as a goal for the Tekton project as well as building a community to share experience and catalog best practices
- We are deeply interested in ensuring the Tekton project quickly evolves to have stable APIs and appropriate release controls to let it be easily consumable
